# Git Punch … ouch!!!

> Using Bash (windows) or terminal (mac) or linux perform the following actions:

- Start by creating a folder named **outter_folder**
- Inside the outter_folder, create another folder named **inner_folder**
- While inside the outter_folder, create a file named **fullname.txt**
- Edit the file using V.I by creating a simple Java program that prints out Hello world
- Save the file and exit V.I
- Create another file but this time inside the inner_folder and name the file blank_file.txt. Now, from the command-line, copy all the contents from the fullname.txt file into the blank_file.txt file.
- Retrieve and print out all the contents that are now inside the blank_file.txt to the terminal
- Both txt files should now have your HelloWorld Java program inside of them
- Inside the outter_folder, create one more file named ignoreme.txt

> To ensure we do not lose all of our work:
  - Lets go ahead and make our folder a git repository but make sure that you do NOT push the ignoreme.txt file to github.com.
  - Now push your local repo to github.com

> Now one more thing: 
- Let’s add a README file to this project
- Inside the readme file, add your first and last name. 
- Make sure that your repo on github.com is updated and reflects this new piece of information

> Finally:
- Create a new branch named bug_fix
- Create an index.html file under this branch
- Inside the html file, add a link to a youtube video of your choice (PG)
 - Merge your branch, push your code and send me the link to your github repo via slack

### Great Job. Do not forget to DM your github repo for evaluation. Thanks

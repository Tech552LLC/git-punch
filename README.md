# Git Punch … ouch!!!

> Using Bash (windows) or terminal (mac) or linux perform the following actions:

- Start by creating a folder named **outter_folder**
- Inside the outter_folder, create another folder named **inner_folder**
- While inside the outter_folder, create a file named **Main.java**
- Edit the file using V.I by creating a simple Java program that prints out Hello world!
- Save the file and exit V.I. 
- Here is a resource for the VI editor - https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/introduction-vi-editor#:~:text=To%20save%20a%20file%2C%20you,save%2C%20and%20quit%20means%20exit.
- Next, create another file but this time inside the **inner_folder** and name the file **blank_file.txt**.
- Next, copy all the contents from the **Main.java** file into the **blank_file.txt** file using a command from the command-line.
- Retrieve and print out all the contents (Hello world Java program) that are now inside the blank_file.txt to the terminal
- Both files should now have your HelloWorld Java program inside of them.
- Inside the outter_folder, create one more file named ignoreme.txt

> To ensure we do not lose all of our work:
  - Lets go ahead and make our folder a git repository but make sure that you do NOT push the ignoreme.txt file to github.com. (Hint: gitignore)
  - Now push your local repo to github.com

> One more thing: 
- Let’s add a README.md file to this project from the command line
- Inside the README.md file, add your first and last name. 
- Make sure that your repo on github.com is updated with your local repo by pushing your code again!

> Finally:
- Create a new branch named bug_fix
- Create an index.html file under this branch while in the **outter_folder**
- Inside the html file, add a link to a youtube video of your choice (PG)
- Merge your branch, push your code and send me the link to your github repo via slack
### Great Job. Do not forget to DM your github repo for evaluation.

## Extra Credit
- Read Chapter 1 ( pages 2 and 3 ) in the Headfrst Java text book and be prepared for a code review.
 Code review consits of you compiling and running your HelloWorld java program (Main.java) file from the commandline. 


# WEEKEND HOMEWORK 
```Using IntelliJ and the Head first java text book, work on the following: ```
- Chapter 1 page 14  and 16 (fix bugs and code along)
- Chapter 2 page 38 (Guessing game) code along

- Push code to github and dm by 12 midnight on Sunday (September 10, 2023) else earn an infraction!
